# The Long Part With Extra Information That You May Or May Not Be Interested In
## What is this account?
This is my original github account. I also have mfjurbala. I decided to create two accounts to have a more professional one and a more fun one.

This account is the "fun" one since CoolHwhipMike is a silly name that I've used since my Xbox 360 days. I still use CoolHwhipMike for the above mentioned social media and YouTube channel. Join me on any of those for content that is random, i.e. things that I do when I'm bored.

Take a look at my mfjurbala Github, YouTube, and social media for more tech/development based educational material.
